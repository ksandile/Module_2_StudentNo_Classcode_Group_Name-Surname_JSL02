# [JSL02] Submission: Debug the DOM
## Checking for duplicates for duplicates, when checking for duplicate there is one thing running through my head is querySelectorAll, what does querySelectorAll does is validate all our existing goals. We do so repeatedly to each goal we have and check if the text content matches the input goal.

## We query all existing goals using goalList.querySelectorAll('li'). We iterate over each existing goal and check if its text content matches the input goal. If a duplicate is found, we set the isDuplicate flag to true and exit the loop early. After the loop, if isDuplicate is true, we display an alert to the user and return from the function to prevent adding the duplicate goal. If no duplicate is found, we proceed with creating a new goal element and appending it to the goal list.
